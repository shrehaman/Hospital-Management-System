#  Hospital Management System


-The Hospital Management System is a comprehensive Java application designed to streamline various administrative and operational tasks in a hospital or healthcare facility. The system provides a centralized platform to manage hospital facilities, patient records, doctor information, and other essential aspects of hospital operations.


- Hospital Facilities Management: The system allows administrators to manage hospital facilities such as ambulance services, medical supplies, and equipment inventory. It enables tracking of available resources, scheduling maintenance activities, and ensuring seamless operations.

- Patient Management: The system facilitates efficient management of patient records, including registration, appointment scheduling, medical history, and billing information. It enables quick retrieval of patient details, ensuring accurate diagnosis and treatment.

- Doctor Information: The system maintains a comprehensive database of doctors associated with the hospital. It includes information about their specialties, qualifications, availability, and appointment schedules. This feature enables efficient doctor-patient matching and improves overall healthcare service delivery.

- Appointment Scheduling: The system provides functionality for patients to schedule appointments with doctors based on their availability. It offers convenient options for selecting preferred dates, times, and doctors, reducing waiting times and ensuring efficient utilization of medical resources.
